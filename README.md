# Devfights (Name Subject to Change 👀)

Devfights is an interface for [#codefights](https://dev-s.slack.com/messages/codefights/) and [Codefights](codefights.com) and name is subject to change.

## Stuff to use

## Features

A scheduled scraper should run every hour/day and pull all data from Codefights.

1. Display all upcoming Codefights
2. Display all past Codefights
3. Maintain a Leaderboard with score
4. Link Slack users to Devfights 
5. Add ads and make `v` rich

## Todo 

 - [ ] Write scraper for Codefights. The scraper should start from [here](https://codefights.com/profile/avi/activity) and pick up all the Devup tourneys. 
 - [ ] Come up with schema and store all the data from the scraper
 - [ ] Come with up way to link between Devfights and slack username. May be a slack bot?
